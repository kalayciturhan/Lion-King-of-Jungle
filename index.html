    <h2>Why I Admire the Lion</h2>
    <p>The lion has been a significant presence in my life, representing nobility, strength, power, and cleverness. This majestic animal brings me a range of emotions. When I think of lions, their elegance and royal demeanor stand out to me. Despite the presence of larger animals, the lion is deservedly called the king of the jungle.</p>

    <div class="special-section">
        <h2>What Makes the Lion Unique</h2>
        <p>The lion is strong and powerful yet highly intelligent and strategic. Unlike other animals, lions do not harm one another within their pride, displaying unique social bonds and intelligence in group dynamics. I admire how lions are remarkable parents, looking after their offspring with care and protection.</p>
        <p>A specific moment that solidified my admiration was from a documentary I watched years ago. A lion, ambushed by a pack of seven or eight coyotes, fought valiantly despite grave injuries. After defending itself and sending the attackers fleeing, the lion, knowing its end was near, found a safe spot, dug its own resting place, and laid down to die. Witnessing this dignified and self-reliant act deeply moved me and underscored the lion's resilience and strength even in its final moments.</p>
